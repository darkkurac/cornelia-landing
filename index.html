                                Cornelia is both attractive and highly adaptable. Just what I was looking for. I don't always clop, but when I do, it's because of Cornelia. I love Cornelia. Great job, I will definitely be ordering again! Thank you for making it painless, pleasant and most of all hassle free! You guys rock! Thanks for the great service. The service was excellent. Cornelia is worth much more than I paid. I would gladly pay over 600 dollars for Cornelia. We can't understand how we've been living without Cornelia.
